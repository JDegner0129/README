# My leadership README/operating manual

## My Role

I'm an Engineering Manager at [Hudl](https://hudl.com). Despite industry convention around this title, this means that I manage Team Leadsâ€”who in turn manage engineersâ€”across our engineering organization and spend my days focusing on efforts that impact Hudl engineering as a whole, such as our career progression, promotion process, or creating/staffing specific engineering teams.

## My Leadership Philosophy

I believe (in no particular order):

- **People are moving targets.** As stated well by [Kim Scott](http://firstround.com/review/warning-this-is-not-your-grandfathers-talent-planning/), peoples' performance, aspirations, and interest in growth changes over time as they take on new challenges and encounter different stages of life. As a leader, I'll work to understandâ€”and routinely re-evaluateâ€”how each of my people is performing and feeling about their career trajectory.
- **Leveraging strengths matters more than correcting weaknesses.** Unless a weakness is causing a deficiency in performance, optimizing for peoples' strengths will lead to happier, more productive teams. As a leader, I seek to understand and verify my people's strengths and either find opportunities to leverage them myself or help them see those strengths themselves and use them in their day-to-day.
- **Knowing the why is just as important as knowing the what.** I'm never satisfied by just knowing what decision has been madeâ€”I want to know _why_ it's been made. As a leader, I'm committed to being diligent in reasoning out a change or stance as I'm proposing it and communicating it to others to the best of my ability.
- **Curiosity is an invaluable trait.** Being curious accelerates learning as an engineer and as a manager. Always wanting to know more about things will help you build a more holistic understanding of both systems and people. As a leader, I push myself to be curious about my peopleâ€”in work and in life.
- **Fairness is crucial to decisionmaking.** Even a disappointing outcomeâ€”whether it's related to a raise, a promotion, or a new job openingâ€”feels understandable as long as it's arrived at fairly. As a leader, I advocate for decisionmaking processes that favor fairness and clarity for those impacted by the decisions.

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ 'What to ask in the first 1:1')

What makes you grumpy?

- Feeling my opinions haven't been heard or seriously considered, above all else
- People hearing me but not listening to me
- Being wasteful or squanderingâ€”for instance, participating in a poorly run or duplicative meeting, or feeling I or someone else is in a situation that doesn't leverage their skillset effectively
- Folks making assumptions about the intent of others without actually knowing it (creating stories rather than facts, playing the victim)

How will I know when youâ€™re grumpy?

- I'll typically either shut down and talk _less_ than usual and become concessive (if I'm generally upset or not interested in engaging further)
- ... or start fighting harder to defend my points (if I feel my voice isn't being heard or being considered)

How can I help you when youâ€™re grumpy?

- Making it known that you understand my feelings on something and talking through why you may disagree with them goes a long way when it's a discussion (rather than talking past)
- More generally, just giving me space to talk about how I felt about a particular situation after you've observed me being grumpy in itâ€”during a 1:1 or a video call briefly after itâ€”will typically put me in a much better state of mind

How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

- Either in-person or Slack are my preference! Many times, if constructive feedback is given in-person, I'll take time for myself to think it through and provide more detailed thoughts on Slack after processing it

How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

- As it happens, without a doubt ðŸ˜„

How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

- Typically public! More private, verbal recognition from someone I admire goes a long way, as well

What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

- Often times, I don't need advice so much as a space to talk through challenges that are on my mind and confirmation that I'm not off-base
- Having someone to push me on things I've expressed interest in or commitment to that are above and beyond what I'm doing day-to-day
- Help in grounding my work in my strengths and my leadership philosophy (above)

What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

- **This year:** To feel proud of how engineering management works at Hudlâ€”meaning that I can clearly articulate the value and reasoning in our specific choices around management structure and responsibilities, as well as that I truly feel we're living those responsibilities out day-to-day
- **Next three months:** Establish stronger relationships with peer leaders outside engineering at Hudl and use those relationships to more confidently make decisions within engineering

What do you need from your manager?

- Autonomy, trust, and conscious effort in aligning opportunities with my strengths and interest

From your team?

- _I'm defining team as my group of direct reports, for the record._ Above all else, I need candid feedback on what isn't working in our engineering organization, as well as recognition of what isâ€”in terms of people, processes, or culture. I also need that same level of candor around things I am and am not doing well as your manager.

From your peers? (outside the team)

- Honest feedback on how I'm doing as your peer, as well as communication around the problems you're solving in your org that you think could benefit from engineering perspective or could be beneficial _to_ engineering leaders!

Whatâ€™s your favo~~u~~rite baked good?

- Snickerdoodles and apple crisp are top-tier desserts ðŸ‘Œ

## My expectations of folks who report to me

As Team Leads, I expect you to:

- Be as open as you're comfortable with me around both work and life issues you're facing
- Care about your 1:1s, both with me and with your own reports
- Take time to think about the issues your reports face in relation to the overall engineering chapter
- Act out the attitudes and behaviors you expect of your reports and peers on your teams (work-life balance, engagement, etc.)
- Be introspective and curious around your own career and the path you see for yourself at Hudl and outside it
- Reach out to me if you ever need to talk outside our 1:1sâ€”I'm more than willing to!

## What you can expect of me as your manager

Above all else, you can and should expect me to act according to my leadership philosophy (above). You should also expect:

- Weekly 1:1s, in which I'll focus primarily on what's top of mind for you, as well as holding you accountable for the career goals you and I have constructed together (every quarter), asking questions to better understand your current projects and reports, and checking in on whether my understanding of you (your career, your happiness, etc) are correct
- Candidness on my behalf in what challenges I'm facing in my role and where I'm attempting to grow as your manager and as an engineering leader
- Genuine care and respect for you, both as a Hudl employee and a human being, whether that means urging you to take well-deserved vacation or checking in on things outside work
- Availability for and openness to talking through challenges you're facing outside the 1:1 setting
- Advice, to the best of my ability, on how you could handle scenarios you find yourself in as a manager or engineer
- Respectfully blunt feedback on how you're handling scenarios you find yourself in in your preferred form of communication
